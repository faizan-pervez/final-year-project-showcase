# Final Year Project Showcase

A central repository to collect and showcase final year project work, demos, documentation, and resources.

## Overview

This repository gathers projects and artifacts from final year students, including demo code, presentations, and written reports. The intent is to provide a single place to view project summaries, run demos locally, and access source code for each showcased project.

## Features

- Organized project folders with source code, docs, and demos
- Quick-start instructions for running demos locally
- Templates for project reports and presentations

## Tech stack

The repository may contain projects using different technologies. Typical stacks you may find:

- Frontend: React, Vue, or plain HTML/CSS/JS
- Backend: Node.js/Express, Python/Flask/Django
- Databases: SQLite, PostgreSQL, MongoDB

Adjust README sections in each project folder to reflect their specific stack and setup.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Git
- Node.js (if projects use JavaScript/Node)
- Python 3 (if projects include Python code)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/faizan-pervez/final-year-project-showcase.git
cd final-year-project-showcase
```

2. Open the folder of the project you want to run and follow that project's README for specific instructions (install dependencies, set environment variables, run migrations, etc.).

## Usage

Each subfolder should contain its own README with project-specific instructions. For example, to run a Node.js demo:

```
cd path/to/project
npm install
npm start
```

Or for a Python demo:

```
cd path/to/project
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\\Scripts\\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```
